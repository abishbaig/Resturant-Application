<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
This project is a food ordering and delivery platform that utilizes various programming concepts such as static, constants, enum variables, user and library define functions, selection structures, repetition structures, arrays, structures/classes and pointers in C++.
This food ordering application will provide a simple interface to the applicants e.g. Admin, Seller and Buyer to log in. After login into the system there will be different interface for each type of the user. For login each user will require a username and password. While writing the password you need to display only (*) instead of original letters/words.</p>  
<h2>Admin Interface</h2>
<p>The Admin Interface allows the administrator to add or remove restaurants from this food ordering application. Admin can also update the information of any restaurant by searching the restaurant by restaurant ID. Each restaurant will have its name, id and location. Admin can also view the sales of a restaurant. Admin can register/remove/update/delete the seller information along with the total sales of a specific seller. On each menu you’re required to provide an extra option to return to the previous menu and an option to return the main menu of the admin interface.</p>
<h2>Seller Interface</h2>
<p>To login into the seller interface, user will provide the credentials i.e. user name and password to login into the system. The Seller Interface allows the seller to search any restaurant and display the food menu of specified restaurant. In the restaurant food menu, food items will be displayed along with their quantity and cost price. You can also another attribute named discount and any of the food item that will be applied to calculated cost of that specific food item. This interface will allow seller to sell only one item per transaction. The system will require an input to enter/select the food item and quantity to sale it. As the seller sales a food item, you’re required to calculate the remaining quantity of the food item and update the sale amount for that specific seller. On each menu you’re required to provide an extra option to return to the previous menu and an option to return the main menu of the seller interface.</p> 
<h2>Buyer Interface</h2>
<p>This interface requires no credentials and displays the list of registered restaurants, total dishes and location. Just below the list of the restaurants, system will ask the user to select the restaurant or return to the main menu. Upon selecting a specific restaurant, the system will display the list of food items available in the restaurant along with their quantity, price and any discount if available. Buyer can select multiple dishes/food items to buy and the system will display the order details of the customer and will ask the buyer to proceed further to pay for the order then user will enter the required order amount which will be added to the total sale of the specific restaurant. If the buyer don’t proceed further to pay the amount the order will be cancelled and system will display the main menu of the buyer interface.</p>
